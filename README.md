# Atlassian Allianz Data Competition

<img src="/pictures/pic5.JPG" alt="Home Page Pictures">

I've had the privilege to compete in the UNSW Atlassian Allianz Data Competition at their respective headquarters! This 3-day event required my team to classify fraudulent customers from insurance data collected by Allianz customers.

Luckily, we made it to the final round, comprising 4 teams, and ended up coming 3rd out of 75 teams!

## The Team
Had the pleasure to work along side my friends [Keith Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tzekwongtang/), [Yil Seung Aaron Jeong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yil-seung-aaron-jeong-260123198/) and 
[Sammi Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaying-sammi-liu/)! 

## Task Objectives and Overview

Insurance company ABC has been experiencing a surge in fraudulent claims, resulting in significant
financial losses. To address this issue, they have approached you, a team of Data Scientists, to help
identify key areas where fraudulent claims are most likely to occur and to develop a solution to
mitigate these financial losses.

Additionally, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of your data analysis methods. ABC wants
you to evaluate these ethical aspects and propose strategies to mitigate potential biases in your
solution.

You will be presenting your findings and proposed solution to ABCâ€™s stakeholder, a semi-technical
marketing manager.

## Dataset Overview 

You will be working with a dataset comprising ~1700 rows and 38 columns, containing detailed information
about insurance claims. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, policy
details, incident specifics, claim amounts, and fraud reports.

## Marking Rubric

- *Data Analysis*: Examines the ability to explore and communicate key patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset. High-quality data visualization and clear interpretation of the data are crucial.
- *Model Development / Solution development*: Assesses the technical proficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution. A solution does not have to be a model: it can be a set of ideas on how to solve the given problem.
- *Ethical Considerations* - Evaluates awareness and handling of ethical issues related to analysis and solutions. The goal is to create solutions that are not only effective but also ethically sound.
- *Adaptation to the Target Audience & Background*
- *Innovation and Creativity*
- *Clarity & Organisation of Presentation / Engaging & Persuasive Delivery*
- *Effective Use of Visuals & Supportive Materials*

## Workflow

## Solution Overview

1. Data Collection and Cleaning: We started by gathering the provided insurance data and performed initial cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted a thorough EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies.
2. Feature Engineering: We created new features to improve the predictive power of our models. This included deriving features related to customer behavior and claim history.
3. Model Selection and Training: We experimented with various machine learning models such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and Catboost. We used cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.
4. Evaluation and Validation: We validated our model using a separate validation set to ensure it generalized well to unseen data. We also used different metrics to evaluate performance.
5. Presentation: Finally, we prepared and delivered a presentation to the data science teams at Allianz and Atlassian, showcasing our methodology, results, and the impact of our solution.
